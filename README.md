# Thanks for checking out my Github!

I'm Ryan, a senior software engineer at [Datto](https://www.datto.com/) with a passion for democratizing tech.

Recently, I have been working on data backup and recovery software in C++, Python, and PHP. This software is designed to be a turn-key solution, making it simple for small and medium businesses to protect their data in an increasingly dangerous cyber landscape.

In the past, I have worked at [PerkinElmer](https://www.perkinelmer.com/) where I created a prototype of how to transition the traditional ICP-OES instruments to a [cloud backend](https://mack-ryan.com/cloud-enabled-lab/) infrastructure to allow scientists of any technical ability to quickly and easily share data from experiments with their peers. I also worked at [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html) where I worked on genetic sequencing instruments. The goal was to take a multiday workflow that involved multiple instruments down to one single 8-hour workflow using a single machine. I believe that simplicity is key when designing software for my customers.

Always excited to start new endevours so feel free to reach out to collaborate!
