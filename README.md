# Thanks for checking out my Github!

I'm Ryan, a senior software engineer at [Cisco ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/) with a passion for democratizing tech.

Recently, I have been working on a SaaS app called [ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com), which strives to be the Google Maps of the internet. Using languages like C++, Java, Rust, Python, and more in a massively scalable Kubernetes deployment in AWS, I contribute to this mission, enabling customers around the world to understand network outages and react with insights they could have never had before. Check it out our free [outage map](https://www.thousandeyes.com/outages/).

In the past, I have worked at [Datto](https://www.datto.com/) where I created best-in-class backup solutions for small and medium businesses as a vendor in the MSP channel. Before that, at [PerkinElmer](https://www.perkinelmer.com/) I worked to create a prototype of how to transition the traditional ICP-OES instruments to a [cloud backend](https://mack-ryan.com/cloud-enabled-lab/) infrastructure to allow scientists of any technical ability to quickly and easily share data from experiments with their peers. I also worked at [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html) where I worked on genetic sequencing instruments. The goal was to take a multiday workflow that involved multiple instruments down to one single 8-hour workflow using a single machine. I believe that simplicity is key when designing software for my customers.

Always excited to start new endevours so feel free to reach out to collaborate!
